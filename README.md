## Welcome!


### My name is Ryan Sarll and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer!

I am currently with [FamilyProud](https://www.familyproud.com/) expanding my skills in Web Development through React, React Native, Node.js, and a few other frameworks. Being focused on primarily advanced Javscript and Typescript throughout my day, I always love expanding my experiences and growing my knowledge in software development which is why I chose a fun project that I am currently working on about how to create my own artificial neural network (ANN) to better understand artificial intelligence (AI) through Python. You can find that project [Here!](https://github.com/LionSnarl/Hello_world) 

I bear years of exceptional experience with customer relations, high-pressure problem solving through critical thinking, and a strong sense of professionalism through stellar communication in the form of leadership.

As a Graduate of San Diego based [LEARNAcademy](https://www.learnacademy.org/), I experienced over 650 hours of coding with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails & React on Rails. Working individually, pair programming, and in a team; I've experienced countless real world experiences at LEARN Academy that help push my ability to contribute to clean, consise code that everyone can benefit from.

When I am not focusing on Software Development, you can find me year-round with a wooden board beneath my feet on hard concrete, over fresh snow, or in strong waters. You may even catch me whistling or singing too, but infrequent.
