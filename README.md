## Welcome!


### My name is Ryan Sarll and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer!

I bear years of exceptional experience with customer relations, high-pressure problem solving through critical thinking, and a strong sense of professionalism through stellar communication in a natural form of leadership.

As a Graduate of San Diego based [LEARNAcademy](https://www.learnacademy.org/), I experienced over 650 hours of coding with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails & React on Rails. Working individually, pair programming, and in a team; I've experienced countless real world experiences at LEARN Academy that help push my ability to contribute to clean, consise code that everyone can benefit from.

I am currently with [FamilyProud](https://www.familyproud.com/) expanding my skills in Web Development through React, React Native, Node.js, and a few other frameworks. Being focused on primarily advanced Javscript and Typescript throughout my day, I always love expanding my experiences and growing my knowledge in software development which is why I chose a fun project that I am currently working on about how to create my own artificial neural network (ANN) to better understand artificial intelligence (AI) through Python. You can find that project [Here!](https://github.com/LionSnarl/Hello_world) 

I also have an open source project that my team would love your help with! It's a React-on-Rails application seen [Here!](http://barcrawlz.herokuapp.com/) We wanted to make it easier for everyone to plan their special night out. With our application, you are able to name your own "bar crawl", add any kind of establishment to your heart's desires, and share that list with your friends! [See for yourself!](http://barcrawlz.herokuapp.com/)

When I am not focusing on Software Development, you can find me year-round with a wooden board beneath my feet on hard concrete, over fresh snow, or in strong waters. I love being outdoors, active on my feet and in nature's elements!
