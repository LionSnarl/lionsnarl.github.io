## Welcome!


### My name is Ryan Sarll and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer!

I am currently with [LEARN Academy](https://www.learnacademy.org/) solidifying my skills in Web Development. I always love expanding my experiences and growing my knowledge in software development which is why I chose a fun project that I am currently working on about how to create my own artificial neural network (ANN) to better understand artificial intelligence (AI) through Python. You can find that project [Here!](https://github.com/LionSnarl/Hello_world)

I bear years of exceptional experience with customer relations, high-pressure problem solving through critical thinking, and a strong sense of professionalism through stellar communication by leadership.

When I am not focusing on Software Development, you can find me year-round with a board beneath my feet on hard concrete, over fresh snow, or in strong waters.
